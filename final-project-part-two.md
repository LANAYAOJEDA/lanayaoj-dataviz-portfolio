## Target audience

**Primary Audience:**

Current and potential WIC participants, including young mothers, caregivers, and immigrants who are eligible for WIC services but may be unaware, unsure, or hesitant to access them due to political or cultural concerns.

**Secondary Audience:**

- WIC agency staff or administrators, especially those not currently participating in WICANYS.  
- Advocacy organizations and policymakers who influence funding and support for WIC programs.


## Interview script

Introduction:
Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I’m hoping to get your perspective on the WIC program and your impressions of a story we’re using to raise awareness and encourage action. This conversation should take about 15–20 minutes and there are no right or wrong answers — I’m just interested in your honest feedback.


| **Goal** | **Interview Question** |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Understand participant’s current knowledge and experiences with WIC | Can you tell me a bit about your experience with WIC (or your familiarity with it)? |
| Understand how participants first encounter WIC | How did you first learn about the WIC program? |
| Identify emotional or narrative elements that resonate | After hearing Anna’s story, what stood out most to you? |
| Assess clarity or relevance of the story | Did the story feel helpful or informative to you? |
| Uncover perceived message or takeaway | What message did you take away from it? |
| Gauge awareness of WIC-related advocacy efforts | Have you heard about any advocacy efforts or campaigns related to the WIC program? |
| Understand impact of story on systemic awareness | Did the story help you understand any challenges that WIC participants or programs might face? |
| Discover remaining questions or confusion | What questions do you still have after reading the story? |
| Improve design and narrative impact | What would make this story or visualization more useful or memorable to you? |
| Evaluate potential for user engagement or action | If shown a rough wireframe or storyboard, would you feel compelled to take action (i.e., visit a site, tell a friend, sign up for support)? |
| Open space for additional feedback | Is there anything else you’d like to share that we didn’t cover? |

|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Experience with WIC**                  | Heard about it, but didn’t know the details                    | Familiar through friends using it during tough times            | Knew of it, but not how it really works                            | Aware of it through family; never used it personally                |
| **How learned about it**                 | Through conversations about government programs and the news                      | From people I know who used it for baby formula and groceries   | Probably the news or friends mentioning it                     | Through work in communities where people needed WIC support         |
| **What stood out in story**             | How she went from being alone to feeling supported             | Her fear of the system and how she started trusting it          | The part where she said she had to figure everything out herself   | The moment she finally felt like she had found community               |
| **Relatable?**                           | Not directly, but I’ve seen people go through similar stuff    | Yes—so many people I know struggle to ask for help              | Yes—it reminded me of how hard it is to get help from programs     | Yes—treating people with dignity is something I’ve seen missing especially in the political climate we are in    |
| **Any confusing or incomplete parts?**   | Wanted to know how she got into the program / process             | is Anna an advocate now?                 | Didn’t get how long she was in the program                         | Wanted to know if she stayed involved or became an advocate         |
| **Message takeaway**                     | WIC is a resource for a btter life, not just food help                         | WIC saves lives but not everyone knows how to access it         | WIC needs to be talked about more—it’s misunderstood               | People’s stories need to be part of the conversation on benefits    |
| **Heard of WIC advocacy orgs?**         | No                                                             | No                                                              | No, not until now                                                  | Yes, vaguely, but don’t know details                                |
| **Did story help explain advocacy/system?** | Yes, but had to re-read the section to get it                  | Yes, but flow was a little confusing                            | Kind of—it’s still not super clear what the org actually does      | Yes—it showed that regular people can be part of the solution       |
| **Remaining questions?**                 | How can I help people around me get connected to WIC?          | Is this run by the government or by a nonprofit?                | What happens when families don’t enroll—what’s the impact?         | How do they collect more stories like Anna’s?                       |
| **Suggestions to improve**              | Make the visuals show how support spreads from one story       | Maybe let people click through parts of Anna’s journey          | Break policy parts into small steps or visuals                     | Add an emotional message earlier to grab attention                  |
| **Would they act on CTA?**              | Yes, if it was direct and felt personal                        | Yes, especially if I felt it helped someone like Anna           | Maybe—if sharing the story felt meaningful                         | Yes—especially if I knew it helped my community                     |
| **Closing thoughts**                     | Bring the stats back to Anna’s experience                      | The story pulled me in—use that to lead to bigger issues        | Make the system explanation simpler                                | This story opens the door—now show what actions people can take     |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                                                                              | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Readers didn’t always understand the purpose of the story or its connection to advocacy.        | Move Anna’s story to the beginning to ground readers emotionally and provide an anchor for the rest of the content.   |
| Stats felt buried in the text and lacked emotional resonance.                                   | Use **callouts** or visual emphasis (e.g., sidebars, large typography, icons) to highlight impactful statistics.      |
| The advocacy explanation came too late or didn’t feel connected to the story.                   | Introduce the **systemic context earlier** with a Story > System > Solution flow.                                     |
| Visual metaphors (like the domino effect) were powerful but underdeveloped.                     | Visually expand the **domino effect** metaphor—maybe use illustrations or animation to reinforce the message.         |
| Several people wanted to know *how* to help or get involved.                                    | Make the CTA more **specific, personal, and low-barrier**—e.g., “Share Anna’s story,” or “Find a WIC group near you.” |
| Policy section felt dense or abstract.                                                          | Break down policy content into **bite-sized modules** (e.g., accordions, expandable cards, or timeline-based visuals).|
