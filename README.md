# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University! ðŸš€

This space showcases my work in data visualization, storytelling, and analysisâ€”transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

# About me
Hi, Iâ€™m Lizeth Anaya Ojeda (she/her)! I have a background in web producing and content strategy, where I spent time shaping digital content and optimizing user experiences. My first introduction to analytics and data was through social media management and web analytics, where I learned how numbers can guide decision-making.

Now, Iâ€™m excited to take that experience furtherâ€”learning how to turn data into clear, visual stories that make information more engaging and accessible.

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. Becoming a Better Data-Informed Designer: With my background in HCI, I want to enhance my skills in using data to inform design decisions, ensuring I create more intuitive and effective user experiences.
2. Extracting Stories from Numbers: I want to get better at pulling meaningful stories from data quickly and easily, while also ensuring I present the right data to the right people. 
3. Improving Data Analytics Skills: I want to learn more data analysis techniques that will help me interpret and analyze data in a faster more efficient way.
