## Part III: Final Data Story

## Changes Made Since Part II

Since Part II, I made several adjustments to improve clarity, emotional resonance, and focus:

- Made the visualization about children of immigrants more prominent to highlight the stakes earlier.
- Shortened the narrative to be more direct and action-driven.
- Created corresponding graphs for each key point to help readers connect data and story visually.
- Narrowed the audience scope to focus specifically on New York State, moving away from a national WIC narrative.

These changes were based on user research insights that showed a need for quicker emotional engagement and a clearer connection between personal stories and systemic issues.

## Audience

The final audience focus is people living in New York State, particularly:

- Current and potential WIC participants (young mothers, caregivers, immigrants).
- WIC agency staff in New York who are not yet participating in WICANYS.
- Local advocacy organizations and policymakers who influence state-level support for WIC.

Insights from interviews showed that people felt a stronger emotional connection when the story and data were localized. This led me to adjust both the storytelling and the call to action to resonate more directly with a New York-based audience.

## Final Design Decisions

- Moved the emotional hook (Anna’s story) to the beginning to ground the audience immediately.
- Highlighted key statistics through visual callouts and graphs next to relevant parts of the story.
- Structured the narrative in a Story → System → Solution format to make systemic challenges clearer earlier.
- Developed a stronger visual metaphor around community impact (domino effect) to support the advocacy message.
- Crafted a specific, low-barrier call to action encouraging New Yorkers to engage with local WIC advocacy efforts.

## Final Thoughts

This project helped me learn how to adjust narrative structure based on user feedback and how small design changes (like visual prominence of key stats) can have a large impact on user engagement. I wish I had a bit more time to develop an interactive element for the graphs, but overall I’m proud of how the final story better connects data, emotion, and action.
